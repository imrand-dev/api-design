API is a contract between 2 parties.

- Consumer
- Producer

### API architectural style

- SOAP
- REST
- gRPC
- Webhook
- GraphQL

### Why API design is important?

- Interoperability
- Abstraction
- Reusability
- Adaptability
- Developer Experience
- Security & Reliability

### Well structured Public APIs

- https://docs.github.com/en/rest/

> API first approach priorities APIs at the beginning of the software development process.

### Different types of API consumers

- Public
- Private
- Partner (privately shared between 2 parties)

### Life Cycle of an API

### What is API Design?

API design is the process of making intentional decisions about how an API will expose data and functionality to its consumers. A successful API design describes the API endpoints, methods, and resources in a standardized specification format.

#### Design Process:

Step 1: Determine what the API is intended to do   
Step 2: Define the API contract with a specification   
Step 3: Validate your assumptions with mocks and tests   
Step 4: Document the API  

### What is your API?

- REST API
- REST like API

> To become a good developer, you've to understand business domain very well.

### What is REST API?

REST stands for *Representational State Transfer* and API stands for *Application Programming Interface*. It's an architectural style for networked applications, defining principles for resource identification, addressing, and data exchange between clients and servers via HTTP.

- A resource is any data object or entity that can be accessed or manipulated through rest api.
- Representational state - it represents the current state of the resources. Representation can be XML, JSON etc

### Constraints of REST API

- Client-Server
- Cacheability (cache contrl header)
- Uniform Interface
	- Identification of resources
	- Manipulation of resources through representations
	- Self descriptive messages
	- HATEOAS
- Layered System
- Code-on-deman
- Statelessness
